# Ground Water Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes various aspects of groundwater and soil moisture data, focusing on their impact on wheat crops. The values obtained from this program were scraped to provide incentivizing insurance discounts for our HackPrinceton project, which led to my team's project "FarmShield" to win the **First Position** in **HackPrincetion 2024** organized by **MLH** and **Princeton University**.
